    <h2>
        This video is very old, coming from 2009, and originates not only as a song in the 2000's but as a meme. From time to time, people used to joke around and sent each other this video as a troll, to the point where even YouTube joined in and linked everyone the video when a video was clicked on for an April Fool's joke.
    </h2>
    <h3>
        I decided to place this video here because I feel it should be recognized to many as it is not only a joke and a meme, but also a really good song that I would recommend listening to. Also, I decided why not have this video on the website. I apologize if it does not play as it is buggy when trying to click on the video to play it.
    </h3>
